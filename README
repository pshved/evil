== Important pieces of code

The code that collects forum tree information resides in app/models/threads.rb.  The model class contains a fast, raw-SQL way of fetching posts from a thread, and a faster way of fetching a list of threads for the index.

If you're adding a new field to posts (for optimization purposes, for instance), be sure to add it to raw SQL in faster_posts model (see sql_posts method).  See 239aa4eaf commit for an example of adding new fields.

The layout of the posts tree is in app/helpers/posts_helper.rb.  It contains raw HTML prints.  The reason why is eplained in my blog post http://coldattic.info/shvedsky/pro/blogs/a-foo-walks-into-a-bar/posts/75. WARNING!  When you change something in the post_helper, and want to see the changes but nothing happens after you reload a page, either turn off the cache completely (uncomment the relevant lines in config/environments/development.rb), or erase the cache folder (rm -rf tmp/cache/).  I turned off caching in development by default.

"Wide caches" for tracking post clicks, activity, and access to external message sources are initialized in app/controllers/application_controller.rb.  The implementation of the wide cache itself is located at lib/activity_tracker.rb.  More on wide caches you may find in my blog post: http://coldattic.info/shvedsky/pro/blogs/a-foo-walks-into-a-bar/posts/77

CSS files are in app/assets/stylesheets/.   Pay attention to posts.css.scss and application.css.scss.  Javascript is in app/assets/javascripts/.
